### Designer✨, Developer ⌨️, Coffee Nerd ☕
he/him

Designer at Mozilla Thunderbird. While I specialize in icon design, I also am passionate about all aspects of UI and the UX of digital interfaces. And strive to make experiences that are accessible and enjoyable. I love to code. It's a challenge that excites my brain, and a puzzle that needs to be solved. I focus on front-end as that's where my passions lie.
